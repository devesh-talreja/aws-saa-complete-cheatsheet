# **Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture**

Decoupling components is a core AWS architectural principle. These services are the glue between components.

| Service | Pattern | Key Traits | Exam Scenario |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| SQS | Queue (Point-to-Point pull) | Pull model; messages stored up to 14 days; at-least-once delivery (Standard) or exactly-once (FIFO) | "decouple", "buffer requests", "worker pool", "async processing" |
| SNS | Pub/Sub (Push fan-out) | Push model; up to 12.5M subscribers per topic; no persistence; many protocols (SQS, Lambda, HTTP, email) | "fan-out", "notify multiple services", "event broadcasting" |
| EventBridge | Event bus (Pub/Sub \+ Rules) | Event routing with filter rules; integrates 200+ AWS services \+ SaaS apps; schema registry | "event-driven", "route events from AWS services", "SaaS integration" |
| Kinesis Data Streams | Real-time streaming | Retain 24hrs–365 days; multiple consumers; ordered within shard; replay capability | "real-time analytics", "clickstream", "IoT telemetry", "replay events" |
| Kinesis Data Firehose | Streaming ETL delivery | Fully managed delivery to S3/Redshift/OpenSearch; near-real-time (buffer 60s or 5MB) | "load streaming data to S3/Redshift", "transform \+ deliver", "near-real-time" |
| Kinesis Data Analytics | Real-time SQL on streams | SQL or Apache Flink on Kinesis/MSK streams; real-time aggregations/anomaly detection | "real-time SQL on streaming data", "running averages", "anomaly detection" |
| MSK (Managed Kafka) | Managed Apache Kafka | AWS manages Kafka brokers; Kafka API compatible; persistent storage on EBS | "Kafka", "existing Kafka workloads", "exactly-once semantics", "long retention" |
| MQ (Amazon MQ) | Managed message broker | ActiveMQ / RabbitMQ; for migrating on-prem apps using JMS/AMQP/MQTT/STOMP | "migrate from on-prem ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ", "MQTT", "STOMP", "AMQP" |

## **SQS Deep Dive**

| Property | Standard SQS | FIFO SQS |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Ordering | Best-effort (not guaranteed) | Strict First-In-First-Out per Message Group ID |
| Delivery | At-least-once (duplicates possible) | Exactly-once processing (deduplication) |
| Throughput | Nearly unlimited | 300 msg/sec (3,000 with batching) |
| Deduplication | Not supported | 5-minute deduplication window (content or ID based) |
| Use case | High throughput, order doesn't matter | Order processing, financial transactions |
| Queue name | Any name | Must end in .fifo |

### **SQS Important Properties**

| Property | Default | Max | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Visibility Timeout | 30 seconds | 12 hours | Duration message is hidden after consumer receives it; if not deleted, becomes visible again |
| Message Retention | 4 days | 14 days | How long messages stay in queue |
| Message Size | 256 KB | 256 KB (use Extended Client Library for up to 2GB via S3) | Store large payloads in S3; SQS holds reference |
| Long Polling | 0 (short poll) | 20 seconds | Wait for messages instead of returning empty; reduces API calls and cost |
| Dead Letter Queue | Disabled | — | Messages that fail maxReceiveCount times sent to DLQ for analysis |
| Delay Queue | 0 seconds | 15 minutes | Delay delivery of new messages by N seconds; useful for dependent processes |

| 💡 TIP: Visibility Timeout confusion: If consumer crashes processing a message, the visibility timeout expires and the message becomes visible AGAIN. Set visibility timeout longer than your maximum processing time to prevent duplicate processing. |

## **SNS vs SQS vs EventBridge — When to Choose**

| If the scenario says... | Choose |
| ----- | ----- |
| "Fan-out to multiple services simultaneously" (e.g., order placed → notify inventory, billing, shipping) | SNS → multiple SQS queues (SNS-SQS fan-out pattern) |
| "Decouple producer from consumer; buffer traffic spikes" | SQS (with or without SNS in front) |
| "Route events from 200+ AWS services or third-party SaaS apps with filter rules" | EventBridge Event Bus |
| "Real-time stream processing, replay events, multiple consumers" | Kinesis Data Streams |
| "Deliver streaming data to S3/Redshift without managing consumers" | Kinesis Data Firehose |
| "Migrate existing RabbitMQ/ActiveMQ to managed service" | Amazon MQ |
| "Kafka workload, need Kafka API compatibility" | MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka) |

## **Kinesis Shards & Scaling**

**Shard capacity:** 1 MB/s write, 2 MB/s read per shard. Scale by adding shards (Shard Split) or combining them (Shard Merge).

**Enhanced Fan-Out:** Each consumer gets its own 2 MB/s pipe (instead of sharing 2 MB/s across all consumers). Use when you have multiple Lambda functions or applications reading the same stream and need full throughput per consumer.

| 🧠 MNEMONIC: Kinesis \= Real-time \+ Replay \+ Multiple consumers. Firehose \= Load \+ Near-real-time \+ Delivery to S3/Redshift/OpenSearch. Analytics \= SQL on streams. Streams needs producers/consumers managed; Firehose is fully managed ingestion. |
