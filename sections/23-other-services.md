| CloudFormation | Infrastructure as Code (IaC) — JSON/YAML templates | Reproducible infrastructure; drift detection; nested stacks for complex architectures; StackSets for multi-account/region |
| CDK (Cloud Development Kit) | IaC using programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Java) | Compiles to CloudFormation; developer-friendly |
| Elastic Beanstalk | PaaS: deploy code, AWS manages infra | Developers upload code → EB handles EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS; not for complex architectures |
| OpsWorks | Managed Chef/Puppet configuration management | Legacy; used when existing Chef/Puppet tooling must be preserved |
| Systems Manager (SSM) | Operational management of EC2/on-prem instances | Run Command (execute scripts without SSH); Patch Manager; Session Manager (browser SSH no port 22); Parameter Store |

| AWS Global Accelerator | Improve global app performance using AWS network | Static anycast IPs; routes to nearest healthy endpoint via AWS backbone; good for TCP/UDP non-HTTP traffic; vs CloudFront (HTTP/cache) |
| AWS Outposts | AWS hardware in your data center | Same AWS APIs/tools on-premises; for low-latency local data processing or data residency requirements |
| AWS Wavelength | AWS infrastructure embedded in telecom 5G networks | Ultra-low latency to mobile/connected devices; no traffic leaves telecom provider network |
| AWS Local Zones | AWS infrastructure in metro areas outside main regions | Single-digit ms latency to specific cities; extension of a parent region |
